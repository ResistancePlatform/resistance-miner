This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Resistance, fork of pooler's fork of
Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.  Bitcoin's SHA-256d and Litecoin's scrypt
have been dropped in favor of Resistance's yespower 1.0 in this fork.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Downloads:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/
Git tree:   https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer

Dependencies:
	libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
	jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/
		(jansson is included in-tree)

Basic *nix build instructions:
	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	./configure
	make

Notes for AIX users:
	* To build a 64-bit binary, export OBJECT_MODE=64
	* GNU-style long options are not supported, but are accessible
	  via configuration file

Basic Windows build instructions, using MinGW:
	Install MinGW and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
		* Make sure you have mstcpip.h in MinGW\include
	If using MinGW-w64, install pthreads-w64
	Install libcurl devel (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
		* Make sure you have libcurl.m4 in MinGW\share\aclocal
		* Make sure you have curl-config in MinGW\bin
	In the MSYS shell, run:
		./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
		LIBCURL='-lcurldll' ./configure
		make

Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host.
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also
available since libcurl 7.18.0.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
and all_proxy environment variables.

Also many issues and FAQs are covered in the forum thread
dedicated to this program,
