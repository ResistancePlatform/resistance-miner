This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Resistance, fork of pooler's fork of
Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.  Bitcoin's SHA-256d and Litecoin's scrypt
have been dropped in favor of Resistance's yespower 1.0 in this fork.

License:  GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Git tree:  https://github.com/ResistancePlatform/resistance-miner

Build dependencies:
	autoconf
	automake
	GNU make
	gcc
	libcurl			https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

On recent Debian and Ubuntu, these can be installed with:
	apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev

On recent Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, these can be installed with:
	yum install autoconf automake make gcc libcurl-devel

Basic *nix build instructions:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

Notes for AIX users:
	* To build a 64-bit binary, export OBJECT_MODE=64
	* GNU-style long options are not supported, but are accessible
	  via configuration file

Basic Windows build instructions, using MinGW:
	Install MinGW and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
		* Make sure you have mstcpip.h in MinGW\include
	If using MinGW-w64, install pthreads-w64
	Install libcurl devel (https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
		* Make sure you have libcurl.m4 in MinGW\share\aclocal
		* Make sure you have curl-config in MinGW\bin
	In the MSYS shell, run:
		./autogen.sh
		LIBCURL='-lcurldll' ./configure
		make

Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

You can solo-mine using these options:

	./minerd -o http://127.0.0.1:8132 -u user -p putyourrpcpasswordhere

(Omit the leading "./" if you're on Windows.)  For the above to work, you need
a fully-synced node running locally and with RPC username/password configured,
e.g. with the below in your ".resistance/resistance.conf":

rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.0/8
rpcuser=user
rpcpassword=putyourrpcpasswordhere

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host.
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also
available since libcurl 7.18.0.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
and all_proxy environment variables.
